# Gravity-SandBox
Gravity Sandbox is an interactive simulation built with Python and Pygame that visualizes planetary motion under gravity. Users can create planets, set mass, size, and velocity, and observe real-time interactions. It simplifies understanding of gravitational physics, orbital mechanics, and forces through hands-on, visual learning.
